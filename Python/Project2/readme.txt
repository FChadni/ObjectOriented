Time Took:2 days (list_percentage function took most of the time, other functions was easily done using project 1).

Resources:

Helproom TA:

	Brandon helped with removed function as well as the list_percentage calculation.

	Eric helped with list_percentage concept of recursive.

	Andy helped with understanding recursion using to_string function (he was really 	good at explaining the recursive funtion) I always had hard time understanding 		recursive function, but his explanation made me better understand how recursive is 	working.

	Anna helped with debugging/ insert function.

	www.GeeksforGeeks.com --- reverse function.

	Andrew helped with deeper understanding of list_percentage ( I really understood 	when he was explaining by drawing nodes and explaining how percentage cutting off 	the list).

	Rest were done using project 1 as reference.
