Feedback: I enjoyed working with this project as lecture and zybook notes were helpful. I did struggled with
The last function : digit swap. First of all the function is name incorrectly, I did not do any swap in that function so I feel function naming should be more relevant to what the function does. I was lost in that function for a long time as I was trying to swap digits.

Time to Complete: all the other function did not took much time but the last function took 2 days for me to actually understand the Functionality of it then the coding took couple hours.

Resources:
---Professor's lecture notes and zip file for both stack and queue, more specifically array queue and array stack: functions (is empty, return head, return tail, grow, shrink, enqueue and dequeue) well Professor's codes were used but with modification and as required of the projects and Mimir test cases.

---HelpRoom: Max explained the Functionality of digit swap function and explained on board that how it can be done only enqueuing into array. Sara explained how that function can be solved using both enqueue and dequeuing as condition for us to find out. Also Eric explained to group of us as we all were stuck at same function with the condition of checking replacements numbers.

---Classmate explained how tail is one minus as that will return the last element.
